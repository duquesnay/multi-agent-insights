INITIAL TASK:
Je vois un problème d'affichage en mode plein écran dans DocumentViewer.tsx. L'image semble mal positionnée avec une zone noire en bas et des problèmes de dimensionnement.

Problèmes identifiés :
1. Le zoom auto-fit peut ne pas se calculer correctement en mode plein écran
2. La logique de positionnement pourrait être défaillante
3. Le conteneur en mode plein écran pourrait avoir de mauvaises dimensions

Voici le code actuel du DocumentViewer.tsx.
