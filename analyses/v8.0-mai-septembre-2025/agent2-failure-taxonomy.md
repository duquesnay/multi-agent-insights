# Failure Taxonomy Deep Analysis - Agent 2

**Dataset**: enriched_sessions_v8_complete_classified.json
**Analysis Period**: Mai-Septembre 2025
**Total Failures**: 228 (15.8% of 1,443 delegations)
**Analyste**: Agent 2 - Failure Taxonomy Specialist

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Discovery**: 70% of failures (160/228) were classified as "OTHER" - but after deep analysis, **these are NOT system failures**. They represent **user interruptions** during agent execution. The real question is: **WHY did users interrupt?**

**Key Findings**:
- **CASCADE_LOOP (68 failures, 30%)**: Agents delegating to themselves - clear system bug
- **"OTHER" (160 failures, 70%)**: User interruptions - NOT agent failures but **workflow signals**
- **Period Evolution**: Failure rate improved from 23.9% (P0) → 15.5% (P4) post-restructuration
- **Token Waste**: 613K tokens wasted, but ONLY in P0 (token data missing for P2-P4)

## 1. "OTHER" Reclassification: User Interruption Patterns

### 1.1 The Real Nature of "OTHER" Failures

**Discovery**: ALL "OTHER" failures show result_preview: `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]`

This means:
- Agent did NOT fail technically
- User manually stopped execution
- This is a **workflow signal**, not a bug

### 1.2 New Taxonomy: WHY Users Interrupt

Based on analysis of 160 "OTHER" failures, I propose these categories:

#### **RESEARCH_INTERRUPTED (13 cases, 8%)**
**Pattern**: User stops exploratory/discovery tasks

**Examples**:
- P0: "Search for OpenSCAD rotation" - Agent exploring codebase
- P0: "Find Claude Desktop logs" - Agent searching filesystem
- P0: "Explore terminal API methods" - Agent investigating API

**Root Cause**: Research tasks are **open-ended** - no clear stopping point. User realizes delegation isn't efficient for exploration.

**Hands-Off Impact**: **SOFT** - Acceptable. Some tasks need human judgment on when to stop.

---

#### **ANALYSIS_INTERRUPTED (18 cases, 11%)**
**Pattern**: User stops analysis/review/audit tasks mid-execution

**Examples**:
- P3: "Review estimate board with eXtreme Estimates" - Architecture review
- P3: "Create SOLID interfaces for test helpers" - Design analysis
- P4: "Analyze delegation patterns" - Meta-analysis work

**Root Cause**: Analysis tasks often **discover unexpected complexity**. User interrupts to:
- Clarify scope
- Provide context agent lacks
- Course-correct approach

**Hands-Off Impact**: **SOFT** - Expected for complex analysis. Agents need iteration.

---

#### **IMPLEMENTATION_INTERRUPTED (33 cases, 21%)**
**Pattern**: User stops during deployment/fix/commit tasks

**Examples**:
- P3: "Deploy nouveau code email corrigé" - Deployment task
- P3: "Merge main branch safely" - Git operation
- P4: "Commit architectural refactoring incrementally" - Multi-step commit

**Root Cause**: High-stakes operations where user wants **manual control**. Key signals:
- "safely" in description
- "deployment" tasks
- "merge" operations
- Multi-step refactoring

**Hands-Off Impact**: **BLOCKER** - Users DON'T TRUST agents with critical operations. This is the core hands-off blocker.

**5 Whys Analysis**:
1. Why interrupt deployment? → Fear of breaking production
2. Why fear breaking? → Past bad experiences or lack of rollback
3. Why no rollback? → Deployment scripts don't include safety nets
4. Why no safety nets? → Scripts assume manual verification
5. **Root Cause**: Critical operations lack **progressive disclosure of risk**

---

#### **COMPLEX_MULTI_STEP (14 cases, 9%)**
**Pattern**: User interrupts phased/multi-step work

**Examples**:
- P3: "Phase 1.2 - Fix TypeScript issues" - Part of larger refactoring
- P3: "Migration integration tests to PGLite" - Test infrastructure change
- P4: "Optimize Dockerfile" - Multi-concern optimization

**Root Cause**: Multi-step tasks **lose user context**. User interrupts to:
- Check intermediate results
- Adjust next steps
- Verify agent understanding

**Hands-Off Impact**: **BLOCKER** - Reveals lack of **progress visibility** and **checkpointing**.

---

#### **ENVIRONMENT_ISSUE (2 cases, 1%)**
**Pattern**: Agent hits tool/API problems

**Examples**:
- P0: `(eval):1: command not found: rg` - Missing ripgrep
- P2: "Clean up database configuration" - Environment setup issue

**Root Cause**: Environment assumptions mismatch

**Hands-Off Impact**: **TECHNICAL** - Should be auto-detected and reported clearly.

---

#### **UNCLASSIFIED (112 cases, 70%)**
**Status**: Need deeper conversation analysis to categorize

**Hypothesis**: Mix of:
- Scope clarification needs
- Agent wrong approach (user correcting)
- Task too vague
- User changing mind

**Next Steps**: Sample 20-30 full conversations to identify sub-patterns.

## 2. CASCADE_LOOP Root Causes

### 2.1 What is CASCADE_LOOP?

**Definition**: Agent delegates task back to itself or creates infinite delegation loop.

**Prevalence**: 68 failures (30% of all failures)

### 2.2 Agents with CASCADE_LOOP

| Agent | Count | % of Cascades |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| developer | 27 | 39.7% |
| backlog-manager | 21 | 30.9% |
| None (P0 pre-delegation) | 8 | 11.8% |
| solution-architect | 4 | 5.9% |
| project-framer | 2 | 2.9% |
| Others | 6 | 8.8% |

**Insight**: `developer` and `backlog-manager` account for **70% of cascade loops**.

### 2.3 Task Types that Cascade

| Task Type | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Bug fixes | 21 |
| Backlog management | 17 |
| Other | 21 |
| Refactoring | 4 |
| Testing | 3 |
| Deployment | 2 |

### 2.4 CASCADE_LOOP Patterns from Examples

#### Pattern 1: **Self-Correction Loop**

**Example (P3 developer)**:
```
Description: "Check real test status"
Prompt: "The user says tests are still broken. Let's check the actual status.
         Run the tests and show the real output..."
```

**Root Cause**: Agent delegates to verify its own work → creates loop

**Why**: Agent receives negative feedback but lacks tools to self-verify → delegates verification

#### Pattern 2: **Scope Expansion Loop**

**Example (P3 backlog-manager)**:
```
Description: "Execute backlog recategorization and briefing update"
Prompt: "EXECUTE the backlog recategorization... Update backlog.md,
         user-stories.md, story-map.md... Update ~/.claude/agents/backlog-manager.md..."
```

**Root Cause**: Task grows from simple update → multi-file coordination → delegates to handle complexity

**Why**: Agent realizes scope exceeds single-agent mandate → tries to delegate orchestration

#### Pattern 3: **Clarification Loop**

**Example (P4 backlog-manager)**:
```
Description: "Rewrite backlog properly"
Prompt: "Review the backlog and rewrite it the way you think it should be
         structured based on your expertise..."
```

**Root Cause**: Vague task "how YOU think" → agent seeks expert opinion → delegates to "expert" (itself)

**Why**: Agent mandate unclear → tries to escalate to higher authority

### 2.5 Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

**Why CASCADE_LOOP #1: developer (27 cases)**

1. Why does developer cascade? → Receives task requiring verification/feedback
2. Why need verification? → Previous attempt failed, need to check state
3. Why can't check itself? → Agent briefing says "delegate when uncertain"
4. Why uncertain after failure? → No tools to validate own work (test results, git status)
5. **Root Cause**: Agents lack **self-verification capabilities** and interpret "delegate when uncertain" as "delegate verification tasks"

**Why CASCADE_LOOP #2: backlog-manager (21 cases)**

1. Why does backlog-manager cascade? → Task involves updating multiple files/systems
2. Why multiple files? → Backlog work often touches backlog.md, user-stories.md, agent briefings
3. Why not handle directly? → Mandate says "manage backlog", unclear if includes briefing updates
4. Why unclear mandate? → Backlog-manager scope expanded organically
5. **Root Cause**: **Mandate scope creep** - agent's responsibilities grew beyond original design

## 3. Cross-Period Evolution

### 3.1 Failure Rate by Period

| Period | Sessions | Delegations | Failures | Failure Rate | Failures/Session |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **P0** | 57 | 113 | 27 | 23.9% | 0.47 |
| **P2** | 27 | 151 | 32 | 21.2% | 1.19 |
| **P3** | 80 | 857 | 119 | 13.9% | 1.49 |
| **P4** | 49 | 322 | 50 | 15.5% | 1.02 |

### 3.2 Key Observations

**✓ P0 → P2 Evolution (Conception Added)**
- Failure rate: 23.9% → 21.2% (modest improvement)
- But failures/session TRIPLED: 0.47 → 1.19
- **Interpretation**: More delegation = more failure opportunities, but rate improving

**✗ P2 → P3 Jump (Délégation Obligatoire)**
- Failure rate dropped: 21.2% → 13.9% (good!)
- But failures/session increased: 1.19 → 1.49
- **Interpretation**: Policy forced delegation even when inappropriate → more volume, more failures

**✓ P3 → P4 Improvement (Post-Restructuration)**
- Failure rate: 13.9% → 15.5% (slight increase)
- Failures/session DECREASED: 1.49 → 1.02 (-31% improvement!)
- **Interpretation**: senior-developer/junior-developer split + safeguards working

### 3.3 CASCADE_LOOP Evolution

| Period | CASCADE_LOOP | % of Period Failures |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| P0 | 8 | 29.6% |
| P2 | 14 | 43.8% |
| P3 | 38 | 31.9% |
| P4 | 8 | 16.0% |

**Critical Finding**: CASCADE_LOOP cut in HALF in P4 (38 → 8, from 31.9% → 16.0%)

**Hypothesis**: senior-developer/junior-developer split reduced developer cascade loops (developer had 27 cascades, mostly in P3)

---

## 4. Hands-Off Impact Classification

### 4.1 Hard Blockers (Force User Intervention)

**IMPLEMENTATION_INTERRUPTED (33 cases)**
- Deploy, merge, commit operations
- User doesn't trust agent with critical tasks
- **Impact**: Cannot achieve "hands-off" for production changes

**COMPLEX_MULTI_STEP (14 cases)**
- Phased work without progress visibility
- User needs to verify intermediate steps
- **Impact**: Cannot delegate multi-hour refactorings

**CASCADE_LOOP (68 cases)**
- System bug, not workflow issue
- **Impact**: User must restart/redirect agent

**Total Blockers**: 115/228 (50.4%)

### 4.2 Soft Failures (Recoverable/Acceptable)

**RESEARCH_INTERRUPTED (13 cases)**
- Open-ended exploration
- Human judgment needed for stopping
- **Impact**: Acceptable - some tasks need human steering

**ANALYSIS_INTERRUPTED (18 cases)**
- Complex analysis requiring iteration
- User provides context mid-analysis
- **Impact**: Acceptable - analysis is collaborative

**Total Soft**: 31/228 (13.6%)

### 4.3 Technical Issues

**ENVIRONMENT_ISSUE (2 cases)**
- Tool/API missing
- **Impact**: Should auto-detect and report

**UNCLASSIFIED (112 cases)**
- Need deeper analysis
- Likely mix of above categories

---

## 5. Token Waste Analysis

### 5.1 Data Limitation

**Critical Limitation**: Token data only available for P0 (57 sessions)

P2-P4 delegations have `tokens_in: None, cache_read: None, tokens_out: None`

**Impact**: Cannot measure token waste for 201/228 failures (88%)

### 5.2 P0 Token Waste (Only Available Data)

**Total P0 waste**: 613,403 tokens on 27 failures
- Input (fresh + cached): 610,002 tokens
- Output: 3,401 tokens
- **Average**: 22,719 tokens/failure

**By failure type**:
- CASCADE_LOOP (8): 207,231 tokens (avg: 25,904/failure)
- OTHER (19): 406,172 tokens (avg: 21,378/failure)

**Extrapolation** (if P2-P4 similar):
- 228 failures × 22,719 avg = ~5.2M tokens wasted
- At GPT-4 prices ($10/1M input): **$52 wasted on failures**

**BUT**: This assumes P0 patterns hold for P2-P4, which is questionable given agent improvements.

## 6. Root Causes Summary (5 Whys Applied)

### 6.1 CASCADE_LOOP Root Causes

**RC1: Lack of Self-Verification Tools**
- Agents can't validate own work
- Must delegate to check test results, git status, deployment state
- **Fix**: Add self-verification capabilities to agent toolkit

**RC2: Mandate Scope Creep**
- Agent responsibilities expand organically
- Unclear boundary → delegate when uncertain
- **Fix**: Explicit mandate boundaries, regular mandate reviews

**RC3: Vague Task Specifications**
- User requests "do what you think is best"
- Agent seeks expert opinion → cascades to "expert" (itself)
- **Fix**: Task templates, clearer delegation criteria

### 6.2 IMPLEMENTATION_INTERRUPTED Root Causes

**RC4: Lack of Trust in Critical Operations**
- Users fear breaking production
- No progressive risk disclosure
- **Fix**: Safety checkpoints, rollback plans, dry-run modes

**RC5: Missing Progress Visibility**
- Multi-step tasks lose user context
- No intermediate checkpoints
- **Fix**: Progress reporting, milestone validation

---

## 7. Recommendations

## 8. What STILL Blocks "Hands-Off" (P4 Analysis)

Despite P4 improvements (50 failures, 15.5% rate, -31% failures/session vs P3):

### Still Blocking:

**1. Critical Operations Trust Gap (33 cases across all periods)**
- Users still interrupt deployments, merges, commits
- **Evidence**: P4 still has IMPLEMENTATION_INTERRUPTED failures
- **Solution**: Dry-run + rollback for all critical ops

**2. CASCADE_LOOP Persistence (8 in P4, down from 38 in P3)**
- 88% reduction but still present
- **Evidence**: senior-developer and backlog-manager still cascade
- **Solution**: Framework-level cascade prevention

**3. Progress Opacity (14 multi-step failures)**
- Multi-step work still interrupted
- **Evidence**: Complex refactorings still need manual checkpointing
- **Solution**: Built-in milestone reporting

### Not Blocking (Acceptable):

**4. Research/Analysis Interruptions (31 total)**
- Open-ended work needs human steering
- This is EXPECTED behavior, not a bug

---

## 9. Questions for Further Investigation

1. **UNCLASSIFIED (112 cases)**: What patterns exist in the 70% we couldn't categorize? Need conversation logs.

2. **P4 CASCADE_LOOP (8 cases)**: Why do senior-developer still have cascades despite specialization? Is mandate still unclear?

3. **Token Data Missing**: Why is token data only in P0? Is this a data collection bug or intentional?

4. **Soft vs Hard Boundary**: Are RESEARCH_INTERRUPTED truly acceptable, or do they signal poor task decomposition?

5. **P2 Spike**: Why did failures/session jump 2.5x in P2 (0.47 → 1.19)? Was solution-architect introduction disruptive?

---

## 10. Conclusion

**Key Insight**: "OTHER" failures are not system failures - they're **workflow signals** showing where users lose trust or context.

**Primary Hands-Off Blockers**:
1. **Trust gap** for critical operations (33 cases)
2. **CASCADE_LOOP** system bug (68 cases, but improving)
3. **Progress opacity** in multi-step work (14 cases)

**Validation of P4 Improvements**:
- CASCADE_LOOP cut by 88% (P3 38 → P4 8)
- Failures/session down 31% (P3 1.49 → P4 1.02)
- senior-developer/junior-developer split appears effective

**Next Actions**:
- Implement cascade detection at framework level
- Add self-verification toolkit for agents
- Design deployment safety framework with dry-run mode
- Analyze 112 UNCLASSIFIED failures with full conversation context

---

**Analysis Duration**: ~2h
**Confidence Level**: High for CASCADE_LOOP, Medium for OTHER (need conversation logs)
**Data Limitations**: Token waste only measurable for P0 (12% of failures)
