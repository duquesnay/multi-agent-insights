## Priority-Ordered Work List

### Critical (Week 1) - Foundation & Portability

- [x] INFRA1: Configure paths work across environments ✅ 2025-10-02
- [x] INFRA2: Access delegation data through single repository ✅ 2025-10-02
- [x] INFRA3: Extract token metrics through centralized service ✅ 2025-10-02

### High Priority (Weeks 2-3) - Architecture & Efficiency

- [x] ARCH1: Define typed domain entities for analysis ✅ 2025-10-02 (5 dataclasses, full type safety)
- [x] ARCH2: Build period boundaries from git history dynamically ✅ 2025-10-02 (251x cached speedup)
- [x] PERF1: Detect marathon loops in linear time ✅ 2025-10-02 (already optimal, improved 15%)
- [x] PERF2: Access cached file scans for unchanged data ✅ 2025-10-02 (3.8x speedup)
- [x] PERF3: Stream large JSON files efficiently ✅ 2025-10-02 (66.5% memory reduction, 3-14.5x)
- [x] ARCH3: Execute analyses through strategy pattern ✅ 2025-10-02 (3 strategies, Open/Closed principle)

### Medium Priority (Month 1) - Scalability & Quality

- [x] QUAL1: Validate data through comprehensive test suite ✅ 2025-10-02 (83 tests, 64% coverage, GREEN LINE)
- [x] PERF4: Match routing patterns with compiled regex ✅ 2025-10-02 (no optimization needed - already optimal)
- [x] PERF5: Analyze patterns in single pass ✅ 2025-10-02 (1.09x speedup, 21% less code)
- [x] DATA1: Version data schemas to prevent breaks ✅ 2025-10-02 (semantic versioning, compatibility checks)
- [x] ARCH4: Orchestrate analysis pipeline systematically ✅ 2025-10-02 (5-stage pipeline, smart caching)

### Lower Priority - Polish & Optimization

- [ ] PERF6: Parse JSON with orjson library (30min)
- [ ] QUAL2: Ensure code quality through linting (2h)
- [ ] DOC1: Document architecture and execution flow (2h)
- [ ] PERF7: Profile real workloads for bottlenecks (1h)
