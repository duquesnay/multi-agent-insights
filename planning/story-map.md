# Story Map - Delegation Retrospective Refactoring

## Strategic Overview

This story map shows the hierarchical organization of refactoring work based on the Quality Integral Review.

---

## Epic 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Critical - Week 1)

**Goal**: Make codebase portable and eliminate code duplication
**Business Value**: Analysts can run on any machine, developers can add analyses without copy-paste

```
INFRA: Portable & DRY Codebase
├── INFRA1: Configure paths work across environments (2h)
│   └── Eliminates 29 hardcoded paths blocking portability
├── INFRA2: Access delegation data through single repository (2h)
│   └── Consolidates 40+ duplicate load_delegations() implementations
└── INFRA3: Extract token metrics through centralized service (3h)
    └── Ensures consistent metric calculations across analyses
```

**Total Effort**: 7 hours
**Impact**: 80% of critical issues resolved

---

## Epic 2: Architecture Modernization (High - Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Introduce proper abstractions and SOLID principles
**Business Value**: Code is maintainable, extensible, type-safe

```
ARCH: Clean Architecture
├── ARCH1: Define typed domain entities (6h)
│   ├── Delegation, Session, Period, Agent dataclasses
│   └── Business logic encapsulation (is_marathon(), amplification_ratio)
├── ARCH2: Build period boundaries from git history (4h)
│   └── Implements "Git archaeology FIRST" methodology
└── ARCH3: Execute analyses through strategy pattern (6h)
    ├── RoutingAnalysisStrategy
    ├── MarathonAnalysisStrategy
    └── FailureAnalysisStrategy
```

**Total Effort**: 16 hours
**Impact**: Open/Closed principle, reusable components, methodology alignment

---

## Epic 3: Performance Optimization (High - Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Ensure system scales to 10x data volume
**Business Value**: Fast analysis even with larger datasets

```
PERF: Scalable Performance
├── PERF1: Detect marathon loops in linear time (30min)
│   └── 10-100x speedup for marathon analysis
├── PERF2: Access cached file scans (2h)
│   └── 5-10x faster repeated runs
├── PERF3: Stream large JSON files (3h)
│   └── 5-10x memory reduction
├── PERF4: Match routing patterns with regex (1h)
│   └── 3-5x faster routing analysis
└── PERF5: Analyze patterns in single pass (2h)
    └── 20-30% overall speedup
```

**Total Effort**: 8.5 hours
**Impact**: 2-4x overall performance, handles 10x scale

---

## Epic 4: Quality & Reliability (Medium - Month 1)

**Goal**: Prevent regressions and ensure data integrity
**Business Value**: Confident refactoring, reliable results

```
QUAL: Quality Assurance
├── QUAL1: Validate data through test suite (10h)
│   ├── Unit tests for calculations
│   ├── Integration tests for pipelines
│   └── 70% code coverage
├── QUAL2: Ensure code quality through linting (2h)
│   ├── pylint, black, mypy
│   └── Pre-commit hooks
└── DATA1: Version data schemas (2h)
    └── Prevent silent breakage on schema changes
```

**Total Effort**: 14 hours
**Impact**: Regression prevention, consistent style, data integrity

---

## Epic 5: Integration & Orchestration (Medium - Month 1)

**Goal**: Clear execution flow and dependency management
**Business Value**: New users can run analyses, clear error messages

```
ARCH4: Pipeline Orchestration (4h)
├── Makefile with dependency graph
├── extract → segment → analyze → report phases
└── Prerequisite validation and error handling
```

**Total Effort**: 4 hours
**Impact**: Usability, onboarding, reliability

---

## Epic 6: Polish & Optimization (Low - As Needed)

**Goal**: Final optimizations and documentation
**Business Value**: Production-ready, contributor-friendly

```
POLISH: Production Readiness
├── PERF6: Parse JSON with orjson (30min)
│   └── 2-3x JSON parsing speedup
├── DOC1: Document architecture (2h)
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md, dependency graphs
└── PERF7: Profile real workloads (1h)
    └── Identify actual hotspots
```

**Total Effort**: 3.5 hours
**Impact**: Documentation, incremental performance gains

---

## Dependency Graph

```
INFRA1 (paths)  ─┐
INFRA2 (repo)   ─┼─→ ARCH1 (domain) ─┐
INFRA3 (metrics)─┘                   ├─→ ARCH3 (strategy) ─→ ARCH4 (pipeline)
                                     │
                 ARCH2 (periods) ────┘

PERF1-5 ←─────── (Independent, can run parallel)

QUAL1 (tests) ←── ARCH1-3 (test subjects)
QUAL2 (lint)  ←── (Independent)
DATA1 (schema)←── INFRA2 (data access)

PERF6 (orjson)←── (Independent)
DOC1 (docs)   ←── ARCH1-4 (document subjects)
PERF7 (profile)← (Final validation)
```
